# Introduction

- SISO = Single Input, Single Output → input processed → one output

- Why it matters: Predictability, correctness, and links to the Halting Problem

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

{{< iconify fa6-solid microscope >}} Keep in mind halting detector. Halting detector tells if
a program would stop or run forever.

# Problem

::: {fragment}
- **Undecidability**  
  No algorithm can always decide whether a program halts (the Halting Problem) → SISO is undecidable.  

- **All-input guarantee**  
  The input domain is infinite, so finite testing can’t prove a program halts with exactly one output for *all* inputs.

- **Trade-off**  
  In restriction (no loops/recursion), we can verify SISO by checking the code (static analysis).

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

{{< iconify fa6-solid microscope >}} Static analysis is reasoning about a program’s behavior just by looking at its code, not by executing it.

:::

# Theory Insights

::: {fragment}
- **∀ vs ∃**: To prove SISO we need ∀ inputs → impossible by testing.  
- **Type hints ≠ guarantees**: Annotations show intent, not behavior.  
- **Checker reality**: We can detect some violations (NO), but a universal YES is impossible.  
- **Restrictions help**: In loop-free / recursion-free languages, static analysis *can* decide SISO.  
:::


## Conclusion

::: {.fragment}
- In general, it is impossible to realize DetermineSISO as
  a verifier that always returns a correct Yes/No.
- SISO (“halts on all inputs and produces exactly one output”) is
  a non-trivial semantic property; by the Halting Problem, 
  there is no algorithm that can decide it fully automatically
  for arbitrary programs.
