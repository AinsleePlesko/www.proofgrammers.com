# DetectNoMainFunction

## What is the main function in Python?

The main function in Python is declared, like this: `def main(some parameter):`

The `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard checks whether a Python file has a main function.

Direct run: then `__name__` is set to `"__main__"` -> block inside will be run.

Imported Python File e.g.: `import my_script` then `__name__` is set to `my_script` ->
no need for `main` function.

## How does the main function look like in other languages?

Let's see some other programming languages:

- C++:

```cpp
int main(int argc, const* argv[]) {// call of the function} // parameters can be missed
```

- Rust:

```rust
fn main() {// logic or function calls come here}
```

# Do we always need a main function in a Python program?


In **Python**, you donâ€™t always need a `main()` function like you do in languages such as C, C++, or Java.  

How Python Executes Code ?
- Python executes files **top to bottom**.  
- Any code at the top level will run immediately when the script is executed.  

Example Without `main()`:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
# This code runs immediately when the script is executed
```

Example With `main()`:

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")  
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # This code runs only when the script is executed directly
```
